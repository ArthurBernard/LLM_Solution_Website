                        <h3>Customized Chatbot Development</h3>
                        <p>Develop custom chatbots to improve your customer support and automate routine interactions. Our chatbots are designed to understand and respond to your users' specific needs, reducing wait times and increasing customer satisfaction. Using machine learning algorithms, these chatbots continually improve, providing more relevant responses over time while reducing the costs associated with traditional customer support.</p>

                    <div class="card-back">
                        <h4>Example</h4>
                        <p>Implement a custom chatbot to automate frequent requests such as order tracking, product returns, and FAQ management. By reducing customer calls by 20-40%, you improve the efficiency of your customer service while offering instant and accurate responses.</p>

                        <h3>Context Enhancement with RAG Method</h3>
                        <p>Improve the accuracy of the responses provided by your chatbots using the <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> method. This technique allows access to internal or external databases to enrich conversations in real time with relevant and up-to-date information. With RAG, your chatbots can provide accurate technical answers, even in complex domains, ensuring high-quality technical support for your customers and employees.</p>

                        <h4>Example</h4>
                        <p>Integrate the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method to enrich your chatbot's responses with real-time information from internal or external databases. For example, a law firm can enable its employees to access legal texts or court rulings directly. This process improves search accuracy and optimizes productivity by reducing processing times.</p>

                        <h3>LLM Retraining for specific tasks</h3>
                        <p>Retraining <strong>Large Language Models</strong> (LLM) offers the most flexibility in AI. By adapting the model to specific datasets, we can teach your AI highly specific tasks, such as understanding technical jargon, handling complex business processes, or automating custom tasks. This allows the AI to perfectly meet your business's unique needs while staying up-to-date with new market information and requirements. With our expertise, your models can be continuously optimized to ensure maximum performance in the most complex contexts.</p>

                        <h4>Example</h4>
                        <p>Retrain a language model on industry-specific data to automate complex processes. For a distribution company, an LLM can be trained to automatically fill out order forms and place orders through a stock management API. This reduces human errors, improves operational efficiency, and optimizes inventory management.</p>

                        <h3>Chatbot API Integration</h3>
                        <p>Connecting your chatbot to internal or external APIs allows your AI to perform automated actions in real time, such as managing orders, booking services, or extracting up-to-date data. By leveraging APIs, your AI becomes capable of interacting with various systems and carrying out complex tasks without human intervention. This goes beyond providing information: your chatbot can directly interact with third-party applications to trigger processes, reduce execution times, and improve operational efficiency. This automation significantly reduces errors while freeing your teams for higher-value tasks.</p>
