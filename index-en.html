            <h2>Our Services</h2>

            <div class="service-item">
                <h3>Chatbot Creation</h3>
                <p>Develop custom chatbots to enhance your customer support and automate common interactions. Our chatbots are designed to understand and respond to the specific needs of your users, reducing wait times and increasing customer satisfaction. Using machine learning algorithms, these chatbots continuously improve, providing more relevant responses over time and reducing the costs associated with traditional customer support.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-item">
                <h3>Context Enhancement with RAG Method</h3>
                <p>Improve the accuracy of the responses provided by your chatbots with the <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> method. This technique allows access to internal or external databases to enrich real-time conversations with relevant and up-to-date information. With RAG, your chatbots can offer precise technical answers, even in complex fields, ensuring high-quality technical support for your customers and employees.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-item">
                <h3>LLM Retraining</h3>
                <p><strong>Large Language Model (LLM) retraining</strong> offers the most flexibility in AI. By adapting the model to specific data sets, we can teach your AI very specific tasks, such as understanding technical jargon, handling complex business processes, or automating custom tasks. This allows the AI to perfectly meet the unique needs of your business, while staying up to date with new information and market requirements. Thanks to our expertise, your models can be continuously optimized to ensure maximum performance in the most complex contexts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-item">
                <h3>Chatbot API Integration</h3>
                <p>Connecting your chatbot to external APIs allows your artificial intelligence to perform real-time automated actions, such as managing orders, booking services, or extracting up-to-date data. By utilizing APIs, your AI can communicate with different systems and carry out complex tasks without human intervention. This goes beyond merely providing information: your chatbot can directly interact with third-party applications to trigger processes, reduce execution times, and improve operational efficiency. This automation significantly reduces errors while freeing your teams for higher-value tasks.</p>
